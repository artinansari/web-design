        is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
        in a web browser. <br />
        It defines the content and structure of web content. <br />
        It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
        (CSS) and scripting languages such as <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

        browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
        and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms
        may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such
        as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and
        surround and provide information about document text and may include
        sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
        interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a
        scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout
        of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
        the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
        use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. [2] A form of
        HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily
        using the element, together with JavaScript.
